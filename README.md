# Supervised Learning Algorithms

This repository contains clear and beginner-friendly implementations of key **supervised learning algorithms** from scratch. The goal is to help students and newcomers understand how these models actually work under the hood â€” not just how to use them in libraries like Scikit-learn.

## What's Inside

-  Well-commented Python code
-  Examples using synthetic and real datasets
-  Organized by algorithm type

##  Algorithms Included

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest (coming soon)
- ...and more to come
